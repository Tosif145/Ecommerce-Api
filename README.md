```
* Add this in ur package.json:
```bash
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon app.js"
    }

# Features Fulfilled

- &#9745; Sign up for a Twilio account and create a new project.

- &#9745; Set up a local development environment. Used NodeJS

- &#9745; Write a script to send reminders via SMS using Twilio's Programmable SMS API. The script should query the database for when patients need to take certain medicines and send a reminder message to the customer's phone number using the Twilio API. The message should include the medicine name and dosage.

- &#9745; Translate the CSV into a more functional database using MongoDB. 

- &#9745; Create a web portal where hospital staff can access the database, add patients, edit medicine and dosage amounts.
